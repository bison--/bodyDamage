# bodyDamage #


fell down the stairs, wrote a program to calculate the damage I took ^^


## Installation ##

you need PyQt4

### Linux ###
just run the start.py

### Windows ###
on 64bit download  
  + [python-2.7.4.amd64.msi] [1]
  + [PyQt4-4.10.1-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.4-x64.exe] [2]

on 32bit download  
  + [python-2.7.4.msi] [3]
  + [PyQt4-4.10.1-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.4-x32.exe] [4]

install both with the DEFAULT settings and everything would be fine ;)

## Story ##

I fell down the stairs and would tweet about it, with a damage report.  
Then I remembered my bad math skills and I am too lazy to calculate em.  
So I wrote a program for me to do it ^^
